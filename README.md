# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I enjoy coding and sometimes I even make money off of that skill. I write plugins and design themes for the popular "Jekyll" framework powered by Ruby. You can view my "Resume" if you want to call it that on my [gh-pages site](https://leatheresque.github.io/) where I showcase the repos you see here in a more visually appealing way.

I am a backend developer, my skills are not in design nor CSS and such, I appreciate those who know those skills and I use them when needed to accomplish the task. I am more into the authentication system, databases, plugins to extend some function, and creating themes to make building and hosting gh-pages sites easier.

If you like my work, feel free to engage with me in some kind of way using the means provided below.
